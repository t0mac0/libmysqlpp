      CodeWarrior compiler can be used in CodeWarrior-only development and
      Symbian development (which holds more compilers) therefore some shared
      flags are exposed with __FLAG_CW_* prefix to not conflict with flags
      imported from makefile_defs_gnu.bkl and makefile_defs_msvc.bkl

      Non symbian block is currently unused due to lack of CodeWarrior format.
