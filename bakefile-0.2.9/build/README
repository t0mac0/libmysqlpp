What is this?
-------------

This directory contains build script to build complete binary distribution of
Bakefile for all platforms. It uses Rlsbot (http://rlsbot.bakefile.org) to do
all the work.


Instructions
------------

1) Install Rlsbot master and agents on Unix, OS X and Windows machines.

2) Configure ~/.rlsbot/agents.conf so that it sets same tags and environment
   variables as in the agents.conf.example file. In particular, the Windows
   machine must have Visual Studio 2003 installed.
   
   OS X machine must have 10.5 SDK installed (it's possible to build using
   10.4, but the resulting binary won't work on 10.5).

   On the VS2003 machine, MSVS_PATH variable must be set and point to Visual
   Studio directory.

   The Unix machine must have Mono installed (it's needed to unpack Python's
   MSI package).

3) Run rlsbot-scons with its 1st argument SConstruct file in this directory.
