#Below steps are what I have done to build mysql++ successfully from source on amd64.
#Right now I have configured it to my libmysqlclient-dev path which you can find
#by doing:
#mysql_config --libs
#it's the path after -I
#Right now I have configured it so that just make && make install would install mysql++
#If you want to build it for your own pc I suggest you follow these steps:


#a dependency
#sudo apt-get install libmysql++-dev
####################
#alternative to building from source: 
#http://tangentsoft.net/mysql++/
#see bottom for fixing compile issues on your project
#####################################
#mysql++ library used for wxipp project.

#to build from source we need to bake it first with bakefile - we first needs tools to build bakefile, then we can use ./bootstrap to bake mysqlpp
sudo apt-get install python-dev libtool \
swig \
#(swig was not needed i think)
autoconf 

#now that the building tools are installed we build bakefile
#http://sourceforge.net/projects/bakefile/

#we get the source from there and its a simple configure make make install

#after bakefile is installed go to the mysql++ dir and do
./bootstrap --with-mysql-lib=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu
#with-mysql-lib=<path> as <path> is where libmysqlclient-dev is installed (mine is amd64 so I had to manually set the path)

#there was an error about lower_str function to fix do
g++ -o test_ssqls2 test_ssqls2_ssqls2.o -lmysqlpp_ssqls2parse -WI,--as-needed -L. -L/usr/local/lib/mysql -lmysqlclient -lmysqlpp

#then we build mysql++
sudo make
sudo make install

#IMPORTANT fix
###############
#watch out for the following in mysql++/common.h, there are two blocks like that, just add mysql/ dir before the includes and it works fine

#if defined(MYSQLPP_MYSQL_HEADERS_BURIED)
#	include <mysql/mysql_version.h>
#else
#	include <mysql_version.h>
#endif

#change it to 

#if defined(MYSQLPP_MYSQL_HEADERS_BURIED)
#	include <mysql/mysql_version.h>
#else
#	include <mysql/mysql_version.h>
#endif

#and its all fine
